# netflow_generator_ipaddrs
This netflow generator coensides with the ElastiFlow ipaddrs.yml file to build a matching netflow dataset. The netflow generaotr using the config.json values and the ipaddrs.yml input file (should be in the same directory as the netflow generator) to generate source IP addresses that match the ipaddrs.yml. I have also include the ipaddrs.py - this will create the ipaddrs.yml with a large number of test entries.
